Landing on a one causes a player to lose all accumulated points, adding a layer of strategy as players decide whether to risk another roll or hold and save their current score. The first player to reach 100 points claims victory in this exciting race against chance. Test your luck and strategic thinkingâ€”will you risk it all or play it safe?",
